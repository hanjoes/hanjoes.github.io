        <p><img src="/images/chapterseven.png" alt="Summary"></p>
<p>As usual, I posted the chart at the top of Chapter 7 which best summarizes what the author talks about in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="Synopsis"><a href="#Synopsis" class="headerlink" title="Synopsis"></a>Synopsis</h2><p>In this chapter the author described different encoding heuristics for how to arrange tabular data spatially. There are several design points we can consider according to the book. More specifically they are value arrangement, region arrangement, axis orientation and layout density.</p>
<p>Different design points focus on some specific requirement, e,g., a bar chart make comparison much easier and also focus on the feasibility, e.g., scatterplot is most suitable for two-value tables.</p>
<h2 id="Interesting-Point"><a href="#Interesting-Point" class="headerlink" title="Interesting Point"></a>Interesting Point</h2><p>The concept that’s quite new to me is the introduction of heatmaps. Although I have seen heatmap almost everyday, I didn’t know anything about it. Below is one of my favorite heatmap:</p>
<p><img src="/images/githubactivity.png" alt="Github Activity Indicator"></p>
<p>Heatmaps are mainly used to encode data that has two key attributes which usually are ordinal or categorical. And one value that has no more than a dozen levels. As shown in the picture above. The heatmap uses weekdays and data as the keys, and different colors to encode number of commits. There are several critical points we need to consider when using heatmaps. The first is the color encoding of levels should be reasonable to human intuitions. For example, darker usually means more, in the contribution graph above, if we use lighter color for less contribution, I think people will hate Github. And also the number of levels should not be too many, as described in the book. I think it’s the average number of different colors we can store in our human GPU when processing the vis.</p>
<h2 id="Evolve-on-the-Originals"><a href="#Evolve-on-the-Originals" class="headerlink" title="Evolve on the Originals"></a>Evolve on the Originals</h2><p>The author also mentioned the idea of aggregating information on a given encoding idiom. My favorite is the use of <strong>glyph</strong> in value encodings. (See the picture below).</p>
<p><img src="/images/glyphexample.png" alt="Glyph Example"></p>
<p>The scatterplot above uses glyph which is a bigger circle with color to indicate the life expectancy and infant morality for one country. From the graph we can know quickly the country we are looking for, or it speeds up locating and querying by using the term introduced in the book. And if you’ve seen the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen" target="_blank" rel="external">video</a> you will know that the glyph introduces more possibilities for manipulation. The user can break out those bigger circles to get the data points belongs to that country, which is very cool.</p>

        <h2 id="README"><a href="#README" class="headerlink" title="README"></a>README</h2><p>This is a really simple version of CSV visualizer implemented using JAVA and Processing. To download the source code and executable, please click <strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mye6asq4q00djyk/Submit%20Folder.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="external">here.</a></strong> Simply double-click on the jar file to execute. You will get the test data after extracting the .zip file.</p>
<p><em>Note: You might need to install JRE6 on OSX to execute the jar file.</em></p>
<p>It has several features:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can use the “Import” button to select the input <strong>CSV</strong> file. The file must contain a header for its columns.</li>
<li>After importing the file, the CSV Drawer will recognize the dimension of the input data and visualize the data using either a <strong>bar chart</strong> (1 dimensional data), <strong>scatterplot</strong> (2 dimensional data) or a <strong>scatterplot matrix</strong> (3 or more).</li>
<li>Currently this vis only supports <strong>number based input</strong>. Which means for a CSV file that contains NAN values (like strings in a column), the data points will be skipped. And if the whole column is NAN, then the whole column is skipped.</li>
<li>The vis implements basic user interactions. <strong>a)</strong> When the user moves the mouse over one data point the data point will be highlighted and a small tooltip will illustrate the actual data for this point. <strong>b)</strong> If user <em>clicks</em> on a specific chart, there will be slider(s) appearing to the right of the “import” button. And user could use the slider(s) to filter the data displayed on the chart. <em>Note:</em> For scatterplot matrix you need to click on the small graph in the grid to display the sliders for that chart.</li>

<h2 id="Insights-on-the-Car-Data"><a href="#Insights-on-the-Car-Data" class="headerlink" title="Insights on the Car Data"></a>Insights on the Car Data</h2><p>By looking at the last picture in the screenshots section above, it certainly revealed some interesting patterns in the car dataset.</p>
<h3 id="Insight-1"><a href="#Insight-1" class="headerlink" title="Insight 1"></a>Insight 1</h3><p><img src="/images/yearmpg.png" alt="X: Year, Y: MPG"></p>
<p><img src="/images/slider.png" alt="Slider"></p>
<p>The little screenshot above combined with the minimum value for the slider tells us that the earliest year of the whole dataset is 1969. (Maybe domestic car is not widely manufactured before that time?)</p>
<h3 id="Insight-2"><a href="#Insight-2" class="headerlink" title="Insight 2"></a>Insight 2</h3><p><img src="/images/yearmpgfilter.png" alt="X: Year, Y: MPG Filtered"></p>
<p>In this screenshot we can see a point is left alone. And it becomes very clear after filtering that the highest MPG (miles per gallon) we can get in 1971 is 35. (And it’s way higher than peers!)</p>
<h3 id="Insight-3"><a href="#Insight-3" class="headerlink" title="Insight 3"></a>Insight 3</h3><p><img src="/images/horsepowermpg.png" alt="X: Horsepower, Y: MPG"></p>
<p>From this screenshot I know even without very sufficient common knowledge about cars that: the higher the horsepower, the lower the mpg we get from a car.</p>
<p>And seems this <a href="http://cars.axlegeeks.com/v/94/Average-Fuel-Economy-vs-Horsepower" target="_blank" rel="external">link</a> verifies this conclusion.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/fourlevelsofvalidation.png" alt="The Four-level Framework"></p>
<p>In this chapter the author talked about the “Four-Level Validation Framework”. To be more specific they are “the domain situation”, “visual encoding interaction idiom”, “data/task abstraction” and “algorithm”.</p>
<p>And also we have different angles to attack those different layers. We could do it from bottom-up or we can also be driven by a specific problem. In a real situation the latter is more natural for people like myself because to me data vis is more like a tool to use to solve problems. So instead of investing years of time to researching how to build better lower infrastructure upon which people can build great data vis, I would rather start from a problem, build something that can be used and then figure out how to improve.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that data vis validation also could have a lot of potential traps. A good validation methodology is sometimes crucial and even trickier than figuring out a “solution” (this solution may not even be the thing our user wanted!).</p>

The author carefully introduced the language we should use in analyzing and describing the “requirement” of the user. And at the end the author gave us several examples in the field to illustrate how are we going to use the “language” in the chapter to analyze different vis tools. This chapter serves as the very basis that we should at least be aware of in future when we are building vis tools.</p>

<p>Time flew by, now is the beginning of the 3rd week of my last semester. There are so many things I want to build while so little time left before starting the mundane life as a “coding monkey” (Chinese word for software practitioners since in Chinese the word for programmer sounds like the monkey who writes code. Kind of like nerd used in English.). During the past two weeks I was coding day and night without too much time reading blogs or surfing online. While today when I finally opened up my Pinterest board, there is this cool data vis came into my sight. And the name for it is “Strength of Nations”.</p>
<p>The reason it caught my eye first is that it <strong>looks good</strong>. The combination of the colors used on the parchment forms a kind of harmony. Another example of a similar color usage is <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. But some further reading revealed that this is actually a pretty decent vis in technical aspects. As we can see each node represents scientific publications in a particular topic, while the links shows publications that explore more than one topic or interdisciplinary researches. This vis tool not only makes it very easy to locate and query a single topic but also gives a clear emphasis on the relationships between different disciplines. For the screenshot we know immediately United States has a significant numbers of papers in the social sciences and medical sciences and also has strong interdisciplinary researches pertain to Biochemistry. And from the screenshot below showing the comparison of countries, we can acquire the likelihood of emphasis on different areas of research and by the first look we know that China and Taiwan have very similar research focuses.</p>

<h2 id="Something-about-Chapter-2"><a href="#Something-about-Chapter-2" class="headerlink" title="Something about Chapter 2"></a>Something about Chapter 2</h2><p>The author introduced several “crosscutting” concepts that can guide design choices for a vis tool. To me, it’s more important to know these ideas if I still want to read the book. Instead of articulate the concepts in words, I think the vis at the beginning of this blog post stands for everything I need to know about Chapter 2.</p>
<p>There is one thing that stands out and make me think. It is the distinction between the abstract concept as a dataset and it’s visual representation in a vis tool. For example, a table dataset could be represented in a form of network or tree if there are inherent connections between the values in the cells. This realization is important because it allows us to break the design of a vis tool into two pieces which are the abstract dataset and its representation. For each piece we would have different set of methodologies to analyze it or make design decisions based on it.</p>

<p>This is a required response on the assigned reading of in CS686.<br>After reading the preface I realized that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Analysis-Design-AK-Peters/dp/1466508914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454378728&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Tamara+Munzer" target="_blank" rel="external">this book</a> is really worth reading, at least for someone like me that doesn’t have any former experience in Data Visualization.</p>
<h2 id="Something-About-the-Book"><a href="#Something-About-the-Book" class="headerlink" title="Something About the Book"></a>Something About the Book</h2><p>Before this book, if you want to learn Data Visualization you have basically two choices. First is you could dive right into academic papers, and as said by <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/" target="_blank" rel="external">Alark</a>, those papers assume you knows a lot in the field. So the learning curve becomes very steep although the things you read is really “fresh” and you know right away where the idea originates from (may not be useful but sometimes makes me feel its more trust-worthy). Another way is to read some book that’s related to Data Visualization, like some Computer Graphics books, which don’t really talk about Data Visualization systematically, or some other books that really focused on the foundation of Data Visualization (the “from bottom to top way” as described by Tamara Munzner).</p>
<p>Neither of the two ways of learning gives readers enough insights with which they can use immediately into the projects they care about. And that’s the reason for the VAD book. Which focuses on the patterns &amp; frameworks that help readers make the right design decisions and, even more, with those higher level concepts in mind it would become easier to read those academic papers if the reader wants to dig further.</p>
<h2 id="Something-About-Chapter-1"><a href="#Something-About-Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Something About Chapter 1"></a>Something About Chapter 1</h2><p>The first chapter of this book is really explaining what is Data Visualization. The author starts from a fairly abstract definition of “vis” (I will start to use this phrase from now on since it’s adopted by the author) and asking potential questions on the definition. Instead of writing a list that rephrases the things the author described in the chapter. I want to talk a little about something that really enlightened me.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1.2, when the author is trying to explain human’s role with the vis tool, she mentioned that the “many kinds of uses” of a vis tool which can be for both transitional use or for long-term use. This indeed opened up my mind about tooling in a large project, and possible usage of vis tools.</p>
<p>A simplest example is when we are writing a small project at school, most of the time we will print out debug information. Well, this is a primitive kind of visualization, which is not a “good” visualization simply because it doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>When the project gets larger, the time spent on tooling should grow respectively. And building a vis system sometimes is as important as implementing new features or even writing unit tests and integration tests. A great example is a monitoring system. It could be used not only for preventing regression introduced by adding new features or refactoring, but it sometimes can give out hidden patterns that will cause major crash. Just think of an unusual high I/O wait on your server, which sometimes is not sensible by your user but it could potentially hiding some defect in your HDD which will result in a total disaster in the near future.</p>
<p>With that said, a decent understanding in building good vis tools is very important not only for practitioners, but also for those who work in other fields that is related to complicated systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Retrospect on <em>Hans Rosling: The best stats you’ve ever seen</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/hansrosling.png" alt="Hans Rosling &quot;Casting&quot; Data"></p>
<p>I feel really lucky that I had the chance to watch this talk. Before that <strong>I never got</strong> Data Visualization.</p>
<p>Why is every body talking about it or how come people create a new discipline for something that’s really depending on intuition.</p>
<p>In this talk, Hans Rosling was like a wizard, whose magic is to manipulate visual elements to convey critical information or trends to his audience. I did’t get to it until I saw the pictures that all the lovely flowers grew on the soil with raw data embedded in it. But <strong>data</strong> is Hans Roling’s mojo (of course with his knowledge and experience in this field.).</p>

<p>Given that analogy, learning Data Visualization is more like learning technologies that build more efficient and more powerful engines. And for us computer science students or researchers, our duty is to practice and invent better tools that can help people build data visualization apps either used for a specific requirement or serve as a general framework that people use in a kind of situations.</p>
<p>At the end, please allow me to use another screenshot from Hans Roslings talk to remind me what we can do, and what we can achieve in the future.</p>

<p>Good visualization can let people communicate much faster and easier, yet there are still some pieces of works that slows people down, or even worse, it could communicate the wrong information.</p>
<p>Here we will look at two examples that show us both good and bad visualizations.</p>
<h3 id="Good-Example"><a href="#Good-Example" class="headerlink" title="Good Example"></a>Good Example</h3><p>Below is a graph describing race distribution in U.S. The original graph can be accessed from <a href="http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.<br>I think this graph is a <strong>good</strong> data visualization for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It uses the actual United States map that make the data in the visualization more intuitive. Anyone who has a little geographic sense about U.S. will know how to interpret the data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This data visualization uses the raw data in the “right way”. Which means it gives the raw data meaning that can let people find the underlying pattern. For example, if you are given a HUGE list of race-address information in text form, you will never figure out that black folks are distributed in the south and east parts of the country, but with this graph, you will know it at the first glance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/census_dot_map.png" alt="The Racial Dot Map: One Dot Per Person for the Entire U.S."></p>
<h3 id="Bad-Example"><a href="#Bad-Example" class="headerlink" title="Bad Example"></a>Bad Example</h3><p>A bad visualization is usually some graph that communicates the wrong idea, or express the data in a wrong way. This one reminds us that the visual elements of a visualization is not trivial since it could plant the wrong information into the reader’s mind.</p>
<p><img src="/images/wtf_data_viz.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are at least two problems with this graph.</p>
<p>First the three numbers doesn’t sum up to 100%, but that could be okay because there might be some context that we don’t know (like the classification of races mentioned in the graph.)</p>
<p>Another, which is more important, problem in this graph is that, the bars don’t work with the numbers (African American’s bar is way longer than the other two races while it’s percentage is smaller.). Although it’s possible that the author of this graph doesn’t intend to express the ration using the “bar”, but anyways, the graph still gives us an illusion that the African American portion has the biggest ratio.</p>
